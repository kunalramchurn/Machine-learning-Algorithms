## Overview 

This repository aims at explaining in simple terms the mechanisms behind traditional machine learning models,methodologies and interpreting the model results, and generating insights calling the `Scikit-Learn` APIs using Python.The contents in this repository is personalized and curated to effectively interpret the modelling pipelines. The projects also sheds light on the following methods:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature engineering and Scaling  
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Optimization and learning curves

## Supervised Learning Techniques

A Supervised Learning algorithm learns the relationship between multiple input features (training examples) and its labels/target variable. Then, it will apply the learned relationship to classify new examples/data points that the machine hasnâ€™t seen before(testing examples).

### Regression

Workflow 

Define Problem Statement > Dataset Validity Checks > EDA > Feature Engineering and scaling > Model Deployment > Model Evaluation
