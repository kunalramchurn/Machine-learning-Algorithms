This repository aims at explaining in simple terms the logics behind traditional machine learning models,methodologies and interpreting the model results, and generating insights using the Scikit-Learn Library in Python.The contents in this repository is personalized and curated to effectively interpret the modelling pipelines.

## Supervised Learning Techniques

A Supervised Learning algorithm learns the relationship between multiple input features (training examples) and its labels/target variable. Then, it will apply the learned relationship to classify new examples/data points that the machine hasnâ€™t seen before(also known as the testing phase).
